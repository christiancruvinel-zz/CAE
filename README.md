# CAE
### Computer-Aided Engineering
The CAE is a technical drawing software, with the goal to be used to power another implementations, mainly engineering ones, like structural analysis and computation. The focus will not be plotting, as it does not include support for line thicknesses and dashed ones, for example. This will include drawing tools for structural modelling, section and material definitions, support points, loads, etc.

The interface was made with [ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/MaterialDesignInXamlToolkit).

*The code will be uploaded as soon as possible.*
